##Flattr
The Easy Way To Look Your Best

####Description:
An Android and iOS application designed to help people gain objective, anonymous feedback on whether clothing they own or are considering is flattering or not. 

####Current Features: 
Allows users to take a photo on their phone camera and upload it directly onto the app, to swipe right or left on other user's photos based on how good it looks, and to keep track of how others are responding to a outfit they have posted. 

####Stretch Features:
- Animating the picture change to follow the user's finger as the swipe it right or left off the page
- Add a limit feature to allow users to pull their photo down from the swipe feed after a certain amount of time has passed or a certain number of votes have been reached
- Use IMGUR to store and access photos
